# Sales_RNN

Sales_RNN.ipynb

Objective: This notebook focuses on predicting future sales using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). RNNs are designed to handle sequential data, making them suitable for time series forecasting like sales prediction.

Libraries Used:

pandas and numpy: For data manipulation.

matplotlib: For plotting.

sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler: For scaling the sales data. Scaling is often beneficial for neural networks.

tensorflow or keras: For building and training the RNN model.

Key Steps:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Loads the sales data (likely a time series with dates and corresponding sales values).

May involve cleaning the data, handling missing values, and converting dates to appropriate formats.

Scaling: Scales the sales data using MinMaxScaler to a range (e.g., 0 to 1). This helps the neural network train more effectively.

Sequence Creation: Transforms the time series data into sequences. Instead of feeding individual data points, RNNs are fed sequences of past sales to predict future sales. For example, you might use the sales from the past 7 days to predict the sales on the 8th day.
RNN Model Building:

Constructs an RNN model using tensorflow or keras. Common RNN architectures for time series include:

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): LSTMs are particularly good at capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data.

GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit): A simplified version of LSTMs.

The model will typically consist of:

An input layer to receive the sequences.

One or more LSTM or GRU layers.

Dense (fully connected) layers.

An output layer to produce the sales prediction.

The model is compiled with an optimizer (e.g., Adam), a loss function (e.g., mean squared error), and metrics.

Model Training:

Trains the RNN model using the prepared sequences of sales data.

The data is often split into training and validation sets to monitor the model's performance during training and prevent overfitting.

Training involves feeding the sequences to the model and adjusting the model's weights to minimize the loss function.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluates the trained model on a test set of sales data.

Metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE) are used to assess the accuracy of the predictions.

Visualizes the predicted sales versus the actual sales.


Future Sales Prediction:

Uses the trained model to predict sales for future time periods.

This often involves feeding the model the last sequence of known sales and iteratively predicting subsequent values.

The predicted values may need to be inverse-transformed (unscaled) to get them back to the original sales units.

Key RNN Concepts:

Recurrence: RNNs have feedback connections that allow them to process sequential input.

Time Steps: Sequential data is processed in discrete time steps.

Hidden State: RNNs maintain a hidden state that captures information about the past sequence.

Vanishing/Exploding Gradients: RNNs can suffer from vanishing or exploding gradients during training, which can make it difficult to learn long-term dependencies. LSTMs and GRUs were designed to mitigate these issues.
